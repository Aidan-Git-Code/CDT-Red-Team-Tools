Make sure to change Client IP in Server file before sending

ICMP Covert Channel with Fernet encryption for message and RSA for key sharing
Continuous Connection for callback

Make sure to start client before starting Server

Not the prettiest output but it works

No error handling if server is closed (will just wait)
